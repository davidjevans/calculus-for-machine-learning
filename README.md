# Calculus in Machine Learning

This code was used to help generate a presentation for a AP Calculus BC class.

The presentation's goal was to introduce calculus students to basic machine learning concepts.

This repository is a resource for any curious students who want to play around with plots from the presentation.

## Environment
### Installing python
If you've never installed python before, check out these instructions [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).

### Installing necessary packages
The notebook requires some additional packages that don't come with the basic python. You'll have to install them.

To do that, do:
``
pip install -U pip
``

Followed by:
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

## Making the plots
To open the plots. Open a jupyter notebook by:
``
jupyter notebook presentation_notebook.ipynb
``
This should open a window in your browser. You can now play around with the plots!

## Uh oh, I need help...
If you're a student trying to learn this topic, I'm happy to help get this notebook up and running (even if you aren't a Groton-Dunstable student). Feel free to email me at the email located at the end of the presentation.
